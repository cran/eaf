1.05

* Implement eafdiffplot(, type = "area"). This is now the default. 

  The idea for the algorithm to compute the areas was provided by
  Carlos M. Fonseca.  The implementation uses R polygons, which some
  PDF viewers may have trouble rendering correctly (See
  http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Why-are-there-unwanted-borders).
  Plots will look correct when printed. To get the previous behaviour
  use eafdiffplot(, type = "point").
  
* Attempt to deal with DOS/Unix newlines correctly.

* eafplot.pl: Lots of cleanup.
  (--single, --output, --legend): New options.
  Default to PDF.

* eafdiff.pl: Many cleanups.
  EAF diff with type="area" is the default now.
  Parameter --cex replaced by --scale.
  Do not require ps2eps.
  Handle --obj1= better. Crop pdf before converting to png.
  (--noattsurfs): New option.
  (--output-dir,--output): New options.
  (--eps): New option. PDF is the default now.

* Force eafdiff plots to use a square plotting region.

* read.data.sets() normalizes paths, thus it works with files such as ~/file.

* Function eafdiffplot() handles percentiles=NA and grand.lines
  parameter.

* Fix bug with ranges and maximise=TRUE in eafdiffplot().

* Fix points.steps to work correctly for all values of maximise.

* Fix bug in  eafdiffplot(..., maximise=c(TRUE,FALSE), full.eaf = TRUE)

* Fix "log" parameter in eafplot and eafdiffplot.

* Avoid that eafplot.formula modifies global options.

* Add 'axes' parameter to eafplot.

* To avoid confusion, the arguments 'xaxis.side' and 'yaxis.side' of
  eafplot can only take values c("below", "above") and c("left",
  "right"), respectively.

* Add missing Makefile in inst/scripts/eaf/.

1.04

* Fix issues with only one point in the EAF.

1.03

* Handle maximise argument in eafdiffplot and --maximise command-line
  option in eafdiff.pl

* R/calls.R (eafplot.data.frame): Fix problem with main parameter.

1.00 

* Initial release available in CRAN.
